## Getting Python (this will take some time)
* [Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows)
* [Mac](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)

* terminology time
  * programming langugage vs software distribution
  * python2 vs python3
  
# Goals for Today
1. Get python running
2. Get comfortable with python
3. Learn how to look up help

## Outline
1. Strings and Functions
2. Data types
3. Loops
4. Logic
5. How to import (aka the most important part)

### A quick note
Today we are working on python. However there is some knowledge of programming that is required. Don't worry if you don't know it, please ask questions. I will do my best to answer them. And I will also do my best to indicate when something is a python specific detail and when it is a programming in general item.

## A brief history
* Designed by [Guido van Rossum](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+image+search+guido+van+rossum&safe=off&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS690US690&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjE_eGK6KHdAhXrRd8KHUzBDHsQ_AUICigB&biw=1440&bih=697)
* version 1.0 1994
* version 2.0 2000
* version 3.0 2008 (not widely adopted until a few years ago)

# Let's Get to It (hopefully everyone is done installing)
* open spyder [it looks like this](spyder.png)
  * text editor
  * variable explorer
  * console
  * control icons
  
## Strings
* A string is a 'string' of characters
  * 'apple'  # letters
  * 'blue42' # letters and numbers
  * 'i am the very model of a modern major general' # spaces are fine
  * '7 hills' # it can even start with a number
  
## Comments
We also introduce comments here, the computer will ignore everything after the '#' symbol. There are other forms but we'll see them later on.

## Variables
You can "save" things as variables. For those curious as to what's going on under the hood...in python a variable is actually just a pointer to the location in memory where the object lives.
